# Hello there!
I am Aravind Samala. I am curious about almost everything! That doesn't mean that I am not proficient at any single thing.
Here are my projects which I completed either out of my curiosity or as a practise to get my hands wet in Data science or my boss asked me to do so!

# My work projects

## Machine learning
[EneryInnovations](https://github.com/thyaravind/EnergyInnovations-ML) is a data exploration and machine learning project which I did
when I was interning at Arizona State University's Facilities management. I was involved right from the data collection and 
I used Neural Networks to accurately predict Building's Energy demand.
