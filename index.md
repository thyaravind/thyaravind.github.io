# Hello there!
I am Aravind Samala. I am curious about almost everything! That doesn't mean that I am not proficient at any single thing.
Here are my projects which I completed either out of my curiosity or as a practise to get my hands wet in Data science. (or my boss asked me to do so!)

# My Curiosity projects
**The I/O project** is the result of my curiosity to find out the correlations between our food intake, sleep, activity and our performance.
Read my detailed explanation about this project on my blog series [here](https://medium.com/@aravindsamala/finding-answers-about-humans-using-data-2abf706df867)

# My work projects

## Machine learning
**[EneryInnovations](https://github.com/thyaravind/EnergyInnovations-ML)** is a data exploration and machine learning project which I did
when I was interning at Arizona State University's Facilities management. I was involved right from the data collection and 
I used Neural Networks to accurately predict Building's Energy demand.





# Other projects

## Data Visualization
**[CO2 Emissions Dataset]**: This is a exploratory and practise project where I used pandas and matplotlib libraries to visualize
the data from CO2 Emissions dataset which was originally posted on [Kaggle].
